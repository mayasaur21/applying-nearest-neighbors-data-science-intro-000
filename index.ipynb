    "In the last lesson we derived the nearest neighbor formula.  Nearest neighbors is a powerful algorithm because it allows us to predict other attributes about people using their proximity data.  For example, those who live in a particular neighborhood may be more likely to be a certain age or have similar interests.  Using proximity, we might even be able to determine whether their likelihood to purchase a product approximates that of their neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we'll see how the nearest neighbors algorithm allows us to make predictions with data.  We will also look at the workflow for machine learning in general and see some of the common struggles that we experience when applying a machine learning algorithm. "

Sets the normalization for the sum of\n            this `stackgroup`. With \"fraction\", the value of each\n            trace at each location is divided by the sum of all\n            trace values at that location. \"percent\" is the same\n            but multiplied by 100 to show percentages.

If a single string, the same string appears over\n            all the data points. If an array of string, the items\n            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)\n            coordinates.

To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .\n        mode\n            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace.

Determines how we handle locations at\n            which other traces in this group have data but this one\n            does not. With *infer zero* we insert a zero at these\n            locations. With \"interpolate\" we linearly interpolate\n            between existing values, and extrapolate a constant\n            beyond the existing values.\n        stackgroup\n            Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the\n            same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or\n            their x values if `orientation` is \"h\"). If blank or\n            omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also\n            turns `fill` on by default, using \"tonexty\" (\"tonextx\")\n            if `orientation` is \"h\" (\"v\") and sets the default\n            `mode` to \"lines\" irrespective of point count. You can\n            only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in\n            a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to)\n            other traces in the same group. With multiple\n            `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if\n            fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the\n            later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.\n        stream\n            plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Stream instance or dict\n            with compatible properties\n        t\n            t coordinates in scatter traces are deprecated!Please\n            switch to the \"scatterpolar\" trace type.Sets the\n            angular coordinatesfor legacy polar chart only.\n        text\n            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair.

Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Unselected instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible.
